# MiniGroceryApp
LIST-IT is a simple, interactive grocery list application built with Python. This is my first mini app in Python, and I’m using it as a way to refresh my skills while reminding myself of fundamental concepts like variables, strings, loops, and lists.

⚠️ It’s been a while since I last worked with Python, so I’m going slowly and learning as I go.
